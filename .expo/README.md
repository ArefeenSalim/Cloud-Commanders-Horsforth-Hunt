## Game Description

**Horsforth Hunt** is a multiplayer strategy game where one player assumes the role of **Dr. X**, and the others are **detectives**. All players start from a unique point on the map. The map is visible to all players, but Dr. X’s movements are hidden. Dr. X can only be spotted by the detectives during specific turns when they move closer. The goal of the detectives is to predict Dr. X’s moves and catch him by landing on the same spot as Dr. X. Once this happens, the game ends.

- **Dr. X’s Movement:** Dr. X moves secretly on the map, and his position is revealed only when a detective moves within range or during certain game events.
